JASON File: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mjroidu/Dummy-Data/master/DummyJson

This JSON file describes a list of users & their corresponding periods of activity across
multiple months. Youâ€™ll need to extrapolate this json sample to get a JSON sample for
powering your mock API and your UI.

Now, we designing and implementing a user interface that allows a user to view a list of hardcoded
users from a mock API server. On clicking on any user, a modal should open which displays
all the time ranges during which they were active on that day, with an option to view all the
periods of activity for different days using a calendar.

Steps:
1. List the users dynamically
2. Select any one user from list
3. From User it'll display activity records
    - Month -Date- year-  time ranges: start time - end time
4.  Now you can select a caleder date to check weather the user is present or not
